Instance (First) | Will start the second song where it says the title of its song.
Word count | Start the song on the same word count that the first song was at.

Transition:
Fade | Fade during the lyric so that both singers say the same lyric simultaneously.
Hard cut | Hard cut from one song to the other. Either before the title, during the title or after the title.


DATABASE:

name | song name
next_song | point to the id of the song that comes next in this path to save on computation time.
